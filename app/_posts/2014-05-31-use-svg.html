<p>Due to its small file size and scalable feature, SVG in web is getting more and more popular.  </p>

<p>To embed SVG into web page as an image is the most common way.  <a href="https://css-tricks.com/author/chriscoyier/" target="_blank">Chris Coyier</a> published a nice article on <a href="https://css-tricks.com/using-svg/" target="_blank">css-tricks.com</a> about this topic.</p>

<p>Another way to use SVG is icon fonts. Check out <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/author/mcassandro/" target="_blank">Massimo Cassandro’s</a> tutorial on <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/create-an-icon-font-illustrator-icomoon/" target="_blank">Sitepoint.com</a>. Free online icon fonts generator such as <a href="https://icomoon.io/" target="_blank">icommon.io</a> can meet most people’s need. But if you are looking for something more powerful, <a href="https://glyphsapp.com/" target="_blank">Glyphas</a> is a more professional choice by font designers.</p>

<p>Pay extra attention if you need to add new icons and re-generate your icon fonts.  Make sure <b>old icon still use the same class name</b>. Sometimes icons may get <b>a few pixels offset after re-generation</b>.</p>

<p>The third way is to create interactive SVG with JS and CSS. See my example below. Treat path as a regular DOM element. But be aware of that jQuery add/remove class doesn’t work for path. You have to use .attr() instead or .setAttribute() in Vanilla JS.</p>
