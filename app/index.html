      <p>Sure, starting on small screen (a single tube of content) can help you to make decisions about what is most important on the page. On other hand, big screen gives you better control for overall look and feel (styling) ... <a href="/blog/2015/12/28/responsive-design-insight.html">Read more</a></p>
