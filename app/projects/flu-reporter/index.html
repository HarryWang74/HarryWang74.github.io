        <h2>Project background</h2>
        <p>
            Past few years especially in flu seasons, I used to use https://www.google.org/flutrends to check the flu trend in Sydney area. After Google stopped this service on September 2015, I realized similar data still could be found on https://www.google.com/trends/ However, on Google trend page you have to set category, country, region, time … to find the result. That’s a bit annoying. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So I decided to build a small application called “Flu Reporter” and share it with people who still want to use Google flu trend data.

        <p>Identified requirement for Flu Reporter behavior at beginning</p>
        <ol class="has-number">
            <li>Can send various location information to Google API and read/render the response data</li>
            <li>Can be deployed to serve and works as a website</li>
            <li>After wrapped by CORDOVA Flu Reporter can be submitted/distributed through application stores</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>How Flu Reporter works</h2>
        <p>To get Google trend data, you need to send Google visualization Query with location specified ISO-3166-2 code to trend API. So Flu Reporter’s application logic is API driven and highly asynchronous. </p>
        <ol class="has-number">
            <li>Flu reporter uses  api.geonames.org to convert Geographic coordinate to ISO-3166-2 code</li>
            <li>Send Visualization Query with ISO-3166-2 code to Google Trend API</li>
            <li>As Trend API only returns data for entirely country, Flu Reporter applies logic to JSON response to find data for specific region </li>
            <li>Render data responsively</li>
        </ol>
