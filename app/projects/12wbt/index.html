        <h2>Data Share/Exchange </h2>
        <p>12wbt member site build on Rails Application using mySQl, the public site build on <a href="http://locomotivecms.com/" target="_blank">Locomotive</a> (a rails CMS) using <a href="https://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>. Sometime we need to share/exchange data between two sites.  Eg public site show case most popular recipes from member database.  Sometimes we extended locomotive engine to access the database then use liquid (locomotive templating language) to render data in html. And sometimes we need to use JavaScript interacting with JSON APIs.

        another approach is to build API.  It really depends on the data we need to handle.</p>
