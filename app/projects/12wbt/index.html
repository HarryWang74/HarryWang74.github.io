        <h2>Data Share/Exchange </h2>
        <p>12wbt member site build is Rails Application using mySQl, the public site build on <a href="http://locomotivecms.com/" target="_blank">Locomotive</a> (a rails CMS) using <a href="https://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>. Sometime we need to share/exchange data between two sites.  Eg public site need to grab most popular recipes from member database.  Sometimes we extended locomotive engine to access the database and use liquid (locomotive templating language) to render data in html. And sometimes we use JavaScript interacting with JSON APIs.</p>
