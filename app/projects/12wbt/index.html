        </p>

        <h2>Data Share/Exchange </h2>
        <p>We needed to perform data share/exchange between member site and public site. Two technical methods used to fulfill this task:</p>
        <ul class="has-bullet">
            <li>Extending locomotive engine to access MySQL </li>
            <li>Using JavaScript interacting with JSON APIs</li>
        </ul>
