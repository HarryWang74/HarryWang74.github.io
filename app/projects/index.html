      <h2><a href="/projects/flu-reporter">Flu Reporter</a></h2>
      <p>
          During past few years especially in flu seasons, I used to use a <a href="https://www.google.org/flutrends" target="_blank">Google web service</a> to check the flu trend in Sydney area. After Google stopped this service on September 2015, I realized similar data still could be found on <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/">Google Trend</a>. However, you have to set category, country, region, time … to get result. That’s a bit annoying. 
      </p>
      <p>
          So I decided to build a small application called <b>Flu Reporter</b> and share it with people who still want to use Google flu trend data.  <a href="/projects/flu-reporter">Read More</a>
