      <h2><a href="/projects/flu-reporter">Flu Reporter</a></h2>
      <p>
          In past a few years, I used a <a href="https://www.google.org/flutrends" target="_blank">Google web service</a> to check the flu trend in Sydney area in flu seasons. After Google stopped this service in September 2015, I realized such data would still be available on <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/">Google Trend</a>. However, you have to set up complex search criteria every time when start search which is a bit annoying.
      </p>
      <p>
          So I decided to build a small application that can automatically grab flu trend data from google API and share it with people who still want to use Google flu trend data. <a href="/projects/flu-reporter">Read More</a>
